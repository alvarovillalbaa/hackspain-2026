# Design Critique

This child skill owns structured design critique, UX review, visual hierarchy assessment, and improvement recommendations before implementation. It carries the detailed assets for this lane after the corrected fragmentation split.

## Use When

- The request is primarily about structured design critique, UX review, visual hierarchy assessment, and improvement recommendations before implementation.
- The parent router [`../design/SKILL.md`](../design/SKILL.md) selects this child.
- The work needs this lane's references, scripts, examples, or templates.

## Assets

- `references/` contains lane-specific guidance moved from the original parent skill.
- `scripts/` contains executable helpers owned by this lane.
- `templates/` contains reusable output or implementation templates for this lane.
- `examples/` contains sample inputs, outputs, or usage artifacts.

## Chain Rules

- Chain to `product-development`, `product-marketing`, `testing/frontend-e2e`, `quality-assurance`, `code-documentation`, `images`, `visualization` when the task crosses this child's boundary.
- Use repo-local personalization documents for company, product, voice, cloud, QA, or finance facts instead of hardcoding them here.
- Preserve parent safety and approval rules for destructive, security-sensitive, finance-sensitive, or cloud-costly work.
- Defer Fluid Functionalism critique details to the `fluid-functionalism` reference source when motion or hover behavior is in scope.

## External Skill Chains

Use live external skills when they are installed. If one is missing, report the fallback command instead of copying its guidance inline. Local skill rules, repo-specific facts, safety gates, product/channel constraints, and explicit local exceptions win over external guidance when they conflict.

- `hallmark`: Audit, redesign, study, or build UI with anti-AI-slop design constraints. Install: `python3 scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill hallmark --agent codex`.
- `review-animations`: Review animation timing, easing, and intent against expert motion guidance. Install: `python3 scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill review-animations --agent codex`.
- `userinterface-wiki`: Use interface-pattern references for layout, components, states, and product UI decisions. Install: `python3 scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill userinterface-wiki --agent codex`.
- `impeccable`: Use impeccable UI quality guidance for execution-level frontend finish. Install: `python3 scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill impeccable --agent codex`.
